# Clustering Algorithms
## K-Means and Spectral clustering

The goal of this project is to get more practice implementing algorithms, as well as translating pseudocode algorithms to Python.

Unsupervised machine learning is one among three types of machine learning (the other two are supervised and reinforcement learning). In unsupervised learning, the model tries to learn from unlabeled datasets. In other words, the model tries to identify hidden patterns and structures in the data without a known target variable. Due to its rather ambiguous purpose, this type of machine learning involves lots of data groupings, which is why it is heavily built on clustering algorithms.

A cluster, in this case, can be defined as a group of data objects. The idea is for us to put objects that are similar to each other in some way into the same cluster. Data objects in one cluster should be dissimilar to those in other clusters. This serves our original purpose of discovering the data's structures and finding out possible ways to partition the data. Clustering can be applied into various fields, including data mining, image processing, pattern recognition, bioinformatics, etc.

There are many clustering algorithms that have been invented and used, of which the most popular are k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), Spectral Clustering, Mean-Shift clustering algorithm. In this report, we will be discussing three common clustering algorithms: k-means, spectral clustering, and mean-shift clustering.
